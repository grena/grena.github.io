## Gruik?

> Gruik is an open-source & free note taking web app. You write your notes in markdown (like GitHub for example) and you can save them to be private or public.

I created [Gruik](https://github.com/grena/gruik) few years ago. Firstly, it was a playground to experiment and learn frameworks. Secondly because I needed this kind of app to save my notes / blog posts in order to share them with my colleagues and friends. 

## Why not use existing solutions?
Evernote is damn cool, but I like my privacy. [Laverna](https://github.com/Laverna/laverna) is a really great project, but I'd like to share my notes, to have a comment system & to have a dedicated storage. Maybe there are other cool stuff (_and there surely are_), but it's a nice way to learn new stuff and improve my skills ; maintaining an open-source project **is really time consuming** & needs a lot of dedication, but it brings a lot of nice things.

## The future
It has been a long way through now, and I want to dedicate more time to this project and push it forward, as long as it's cool to develop it and can be useful to someone. I changed the stack to something I know better : Symfony 2 (PHP Framework). It's now possible to connect with oAuth, so no more registration.

The main goal now is to **encrypt locally the notes** using the [Stanford Javascript Crypto Library](http://bitwiseshiftleft.github.io/sjcl/), this way, notes could be saved in database without any risk.

I'll keep posting updates of this project on this blog if I have any announcement. For now, there is a lot of work to do, so let's go! :)

Bye & have a great day!
