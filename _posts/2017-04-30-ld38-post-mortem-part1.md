> Hello there! Here is the first part of the post mortem for [Pod2000](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/38/pod2000), our Ludum Dare 38 compo submission we made in 48h. 
In those articles, we’ll give you all the details on the making-of this game! Let’s go :)

## The Dream Team
For this 38th edition, we decided to team up with a lot of crazy birds! 
We were a bit curious about how we could work with so many people, in 48h.. 
But it went really smooth, and especially, it was hell of a party! Old colleagues & friends, together, in a castle, with the sun, to make a game. 
Here is the dream team, in a chaotic order:

- **Nicolas “nidup” Dupont** - Code, gameplay, story
- **Geoffrey “toxinu” Lehée** - Code, gameplay, story
- **Gildas Quéméner** - Code, gameplay, story
- **Baptiste Quéméner** - SFX, music, gameplay, story
- **Pierre Allard** - 3D, illustrations, logo
- **Mylène Larnaud** - Pixel art illustrations
- **Adrien “grena” Pétremann** - Code, gameplay, story

Most of us are developers, but we had the chance to team up with multiple talents, so we decided to create everything from scratch (so no pre-made sound/graphic assets). 
This way, we could end up with a coherent visual & audio experience. 

Mylène joined us on Sunday to draw the lovely & stunning pixel art illustrations we used to visually bring life to the small world:

As Pierre is mastering 3D rendering, he made the scene with the pod computer, and the 2 first “cinematic” pictures. \o/

Last but not least, Baptiste made a huge work on the audio part, creating this very particular & immersive ambiance you have in your pod and in the small world audio captures.

Some of us already worked together in the past, but we never joined our forces, so it was the first time we worked ALL together. In the next post, we’ll detail the 2 days of the Jam. See you!
